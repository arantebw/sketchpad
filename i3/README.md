# i3

`i3` is my tiling window manager of choice.

## Commonly-used Commands

Enable full-screen mode of a window.

```text
Alt + f
```

Search and open an app using `dmenu`.

```text
Alt + d

Enter the app name
```

Open the default terminal app.

```text
Alt + Enter
```

Quit (close) a window.

I created a custom keybinding for this using `i3lock` in my
`~/.config/i3/config` file.

```text
Alt + x

Vertically tile the new opened windows.

```text
Alt + v
```

Horizontally tile the newly opened windows.
