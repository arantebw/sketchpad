# How to move a commit from `A` branch to `B` branch?

Go to `A` branch, list all of the commits, then copy the hash of the commit that you need to move to `B` branch.

```console
sample-repo git:(A) 
âžœ git log --oneline
bb35b82 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) commit 1
a99d76e commit 2
```

Go to `B` branch, then `cherry-pick` the commit.

```console
sample-repo git:(A) git switch B
sample-repo git:(B) git cherry-pick a99d76e
```
