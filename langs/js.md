The choices you make about how to write your program matter -- not only to
you, but to your other team members and even to your future self.

### Coercion

Coercion a.k.a. *"type casting"* to other languages.

Types of coercion:
- Explicit
- Implicit

If loosely comparing (`==`) two literals, JavaScript will *coerce* the
left-side of the expression before comparing it to the right-side of the
expression.
