# Useful IDE Features

This is my personal list of what I consider useful IDE features that I intend
to integrate with my daily `vim` workflow.

- syntax highlighting
- intellisense (code completion)
- search all, classes, files, symbols, actions, git (all encompassing search
  tool) -> shift + shift
- find usages
- go to definitions -> g + d
- refactor
- auto-importing of class location (framework-based)
- auto-formatting tool (format on save)
- linting tools (errors, warnings)
- single/multi-line comments -> ctrl + /
- highlight multiple instance in file
- breadcrumbs of current open file 
- integrated terminal
- file explorer
- brackets colorizer
- indentation guide

`TODO:` Find the appropriate `vim` plugins for each of the respective feature.
